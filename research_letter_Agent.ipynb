I am writing to express my interest in seeking an opportunity to work as a research intern under your esteemed guidance from June to September, 2024. I am currently a second-year student at the Oxford Engineering Science program, and my academic and research trajectory has consistently been geared towards the intersection of cutting-edge computer vision, machine learning, and graphics, which align well with your areas of expertise.\\n\\nYour recent publication, \"Boundary Value Caching for Walk on Spheres\", caught my attention. The work done on grid-free Monte Carlo methods to solve elliptic partial differential equations without mesh generation resonated with the research I conducted whilst a Research Intern at Tencent Aspiring Explorers in Science. I developed a model for None-Line-Of-Sight Imaging process and proposed a novel algorithm that efficiently reconstructed images. This parallel in our research interests leads me to believe that I could supplement your ongoing projects effectively.\\n\\nDuring my tenure as an AI Engineer Summer Intern at HUAWEI Technology, I gained valuable experience in improving memory management in forward neural networks and developed an in-depth understanding of optimization techniques. This hands-on experience combined with my academic learnings could potentially contribute to your ongoing ellipsoidal paths and time-gated rendering study, where efficiency and optimization seem paramount.\\n\\nFurther, as the CEO and Founder of WeLight Tech, employing AI for college application-related problems, I honed not only my technical abilities, but more importantly, skills regarding leadership, project management, and team communication. My unique background involved leading diverse teams and fostering a culture of innovation and problem-solving. I believe these skillsets could be contributive in a research setting.\\n\\nI would like to emphasize that I am very flexible and do not require any funding support. I am open to working in person, online, or a combination of both based on your preference and convenience. Dedicated to exploring the dimensions of experimental computer vision and machine learning, I am eager to contribute to your research during the upcoming summer.\\n\\nIf you could spare time for a subsequent discussion either via email or a Zoom call, I would be extremely grateful. It would be a great honor to work under your esteemed guidance and contribute to your esteemed research. Thank you for considering my application.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]\\n',\n 3516)"
